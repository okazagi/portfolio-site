After some unmotivated times during the holidays and getting back to work, I have returned to keep learning this. I haven't made a webpage or site since high school. And man, it was a lot different back then. Good ol' Dreamweaver was what I tried to learn. My sites looked so bad. I remember my computer class teacher asked me to make a website for the computer class and it was super terrible. I still remember the look on her face, lol! It was all half hearted though, I had other things to spend my time on when in high school.
