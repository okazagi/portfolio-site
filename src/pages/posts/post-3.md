I like the markdown frontmatter stuff, it makes making blog posts super easy. I don't want to get into a frontend job, but I think it helps to know at least some frontend stuff. I think I prefer backend, there's just a lot more to it and I feel it is more interesting. More languages to learn, more things you can do. I think the things you learn for backend development can be applied to more than just website backend as well. It would be cool to do game mechanics I think. It's always the game dev that gets new people interested in coding, a lofty goal but also I hear it isn't the greatest field to get into. Game dev companies seem pretty toxic these days, unless it is some cool indie studio. 

Anyway, I really like Omarchy. It makes using your computer way more compelling, it's super clean, and using your keyboard for everything just feels right. I didn't realize how much clicking around with your mouse felt archaic. It's so seamless to do everything without lifting your hands off your keyboard. The learning curve isn't even that sharp, DHH did a great job putting all of this together and I am really happy he did. Ever since Hyperland came out I was intrigued by it, but I didn't have the time or motivation to undertake getting Arch installed and riced to a place where I would love using it. The ease of install of Omarchy is incredible, and the aesthetics are on point. I definitely know a lot about computers and Linux, but I am far from a super user and Omarchy made it so I can have that super user experience without having to learn the ins and outs of Arch. Another bonus is that I can still play my favorite games like Satisfactory.

I've been dabbling in Neovim for awhile now, and I really enjoy it. Lazyvim is probably the easiest way to get into it, it is a great jumping off point but I honestly have kept most things as they come. I really don't like most IDE's, there is just so much bloat and everyone is trying to cram AI down our throats and it just ruins the experience. The only IDE I actually like is RStudio, it is nice and simple, clean, and easy to navigate. There's also not that many alternatives to RStudio, Proton is there but I don't know if it is still being developed. Again, they are just trying to add in to much stuff. I think it is just built on the framework of VSCode, which is gross, so I haven't used it other than to see what it has. I'd rather rigt my R scripts and integrate them into Python which I write in nvim. 

I should write a shell script to pre-populate these blogs.
